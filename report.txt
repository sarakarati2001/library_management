Doing Test Driven Developments was a tiring approach of developing a software according to me.
It requried a lot of procedures which should be followed step by step.What i found hard was doing the test,thinking the code of the functions backwards.Another difficult point was how to test the functions with my own tests.Even though being familiar with pointers i faced difficulties using them at certain points.Regarding implementations of the fucntions using files in developing a library system was challenging as i was used to load them manually rather than with a file.However this project developed my skills in using pointers efficiently and also the structs better.It learnt me  to throw a bigger step in c programming languange and reduce the mistakes.
Doing this project time was the msot challenigng thing too.
